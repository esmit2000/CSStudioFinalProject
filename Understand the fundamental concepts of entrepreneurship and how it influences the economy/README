In having created a portfolio webpage for myself containing my collected works for both CAD drafting and programming projects, 
as well as attaching my employability skills in an about tab on that website with contanct information, I can count this towards the 
fundamental concepts of entrepreneurship competency as I am selling myself, in a sense, by broadcasting my skills and abilities 
globally through the internet through my portfolio for future prospective employers to see. This step to invest in myself is supplementary
to setting myself up for a successful financial future and therefore counts towards this competency.
