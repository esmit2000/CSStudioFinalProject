Due to my work on the Fire 21 website, a personal website I designed last year in CS50â€™s web chapter, and my work with the start menu 
and user interface in the sieged.ml group project last year, I would say that I have completed the competency of Event Handling and User 
Interaction. In addition to these projects containing graphical user interfaces that players and users can interact with, my Fire 21 website 
and my personal portfolio website contain accessibility changes such as words and sentences as back ups for pictures that can be used 
when the website is in reading mode for someone who can't see the images, making this more user-friendly.
