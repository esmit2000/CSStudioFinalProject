As president of the Drafting Skills team offered by Kennett High School, I would say that I complete the Understand the importance of 
personal growth and leadership to enhance career success competency, as I have experience in leading a group of people through sometimes
difficult and demanding projects and tasks such as those that we must face in the SkillsUSA State Drafting Competition. In my gaining an 
internship with an engineering company and constructing a resume to highlight my skills and abilities, I am also representing this 
competency by addressing my personal growth and the skills I have gained in my four years of high school.
