In my scratch AP project from last years computer science principles AP test, I used algorithms and abstractions to simplify and solve
the programming problem of creating a working game of snake. These algorithms, called through abstraction, acted to allow for snake 
movement as well as physics and dying mechanics. In my race, find, and fifteen programming problems from CS50, I was also tasked with 
creating algorithms in order to solve mathematical problems to do with the tasks of the problem, accounting for this competency.
