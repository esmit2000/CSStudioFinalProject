When concerning the Principles of Computer Program Development competency for computer science courses, I can say that my projects and 
assignments from the CS50 C programming course that I audited last year during my programming II course count for this competency, as, 
for each problem completed during this course, I was tasked with going through the program development process, analyzing each individual 
assignments tasks and stipulations, creating plans with which I would complete those tasks, and creating the programs themselves.
