In terms of the Creation of Methods and Structured Programming competency, I have throughout the course of 
CS50 created many examples of source code, object code, and executable code through the compilation process of C, as well as using data 
types in structures such as with the vigenere.c problem and object oriented programming when working with C# on the sieged.ml group project, 
however, I do not have much experience working with interpreted programming languages 
such as Javascript or BASIC, therefore I am missing a key facet of that competency, but the attached files from Chapter 2 of CS50 account
for this competency.
