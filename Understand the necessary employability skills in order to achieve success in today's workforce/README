In working with a group to draft game design documents and other planning documents for a group gaming project (sieged.ml) last year,
I am able to show my employability and planning skills for outlining solutions to problems (how our game was going to work and function)
and my ability to keep organized and work in a group setting. In addition, attaching my resume with listed skills, abilities, and 
experiences I have gained over the past four years of high school also show my understanding of employability skills and my willingness
to succeed in today's workforce, with programming problems highlighted in other folders such as calc.c and fifteen.c demonstrating 
my understanding of mathematical concepts through the completion of these problems.
